=========
IMPORTANT
=========
This script was made using autoHotKey. In order to run the script, please download ahk from https://www.autohotkey.com/
This is NOT a perfect counter to dying. If your player takes MORE damage than your Nexus cap, there is still a risk you may lose that character. Use at your own risk!
This script is open-source, and easily editable using AutoHotKey. Any revisions and republishings are common courtesy.

==========
HOW TO USE
==========
NOTE:
      IF YOU ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN ROTMG, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO KEEP THE SCRIPT DISABLED BY PRESSING Alt+M!
      THIS SCRIPT WILL NEED TO BE ADJUSTED ON MONITOR RESOLUTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM 1920x1080. IT WILL NOT WORK

Hotkeys: 
Enable/Disable - Press Alt+M to toggle the script. Recommended to disable while tabbing out of RotMG.
Exit Program - Press Ctrl+Alt+M to exit the script, or check on your taskbar icons on the bottom right of your screen.

If you wish to allow custom resolution support, open the autoNexus script with Notepad
On the first line, make sure it says 'supportCustomResolutions = true'
And it will prompt you for dimensions, etc.

Extra info listed below, enjoy!
